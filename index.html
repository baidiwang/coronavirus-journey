          "What impressed me most is I heard from the announcements on board 'You will get the best cure for the coronavirus in Shanghai' when arriving, I feel very safe. Coming back home is the best." -- Xinyue Yi, a Chinese student studying in

        <h5>Since the the coronavirus outbreak in March in the U.S., it is not simple anymore for international students to flight back to their countires. Not only how dangerous the journeys will be, but also the emtional deperssion anxiousness that
          everyone has.
          By selecting some photos of International studetns coming back home and interviewing some of them about thier thoughts of their journeys, travelling during the coronavirus is indeed much harder than we thought.
